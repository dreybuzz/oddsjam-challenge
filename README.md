## Frontend code assignment  
Given the file `arbs.json` create a table that displays that information. You are free to choose any way to display that information. The goal is to covey to the user that there is an arbitrage opportunity. You are free to rearrange the data displayed in order to convey the most profitable opportunities. You are free to use whatever library / technology to solve this problem based on react.  

## Timing  
We expect the challenge to last 1 to 2 hours max. We don't expect a perfect solution. Please mail back whatever solution you have completed during that timeframe.  

## End result  
The goal is to provide a working table that can be displayed locally. While having top noch UI/UX is a great plus, in this challenge we want to test how you architect the table, how you manage and display the data.
